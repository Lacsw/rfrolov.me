Error pages don't have to be boring. Instead of a simple "Page not found" message, I created an interactive terminal emulator that makes getting lost on my site a bit more fun.

## The Concept

The idea was simple: if developers spend their days in the terminal, why not make the 404 page feel like home? The terminal accepts commands and provides helpful responses.

## Key Features

### Command Processing

The terminal recognizes several commands:

- `help` - Shows available commands
- `home` - Navigates back to the home page
- `ls` - Lists available pages
- `clear` - Clears the terminal
- `whoami` - A fun Easter egg

### Typing Animation

Each response is animated character by character using a custom hook:

```typescript
function useTypingEffect(text: string, speed = 30) {
  const [displayedText, setDisplayedText] = useState("");

  useEffect(() => {
    let index = 0;
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      if (index < text.length) {
        setDisplayedText(text.slice(0, index + 1));
        index++;
      } else {
        clearInterval(timer);
      }
    }, speed);

    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, [text, speed]);

  return displayedText;
}
```

### Auto-scroll

The terminal automatically scrolls to show the latest output, just like a real terminal:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (terminalRef.current) {
    terminalRef.current.scrollTop = terminalRef.current.scrollHeight;
  }
}, [history]);
```

## Styling

The terminal uses a dark theme with a subtle glow effect:

```css
.terminal {
  background: #0a0a0a;
  border: 1px solid #333;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.1);
}
```

The blinking cursor is achieved with CSS animation:

```css
.cursor {
  animation: blink 1s step-end infinite;
}

@keyframes blink {
  50% { opacity: 0; }
}
```

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Keyboard focus** - The input is auto-focused when the page loads
2. **Mobile support** - Works on touch devices too
3. **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
4. **Helpful defaults** - Typing `help` is suggested immediately

## Try It Out

Navigate to a non-existent page like [/this-page-does-not-exist](/this-page-does-not-exist) to see it in action!

## Conclusion

Small details like a creative 404 page can make a portfolio memorable. It shows personality and attention to detail while demonstrating technical skills.
