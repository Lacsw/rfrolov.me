Building a developer portfolio is one of those projects that seems simple on the surface but offers endless opportunities for learning and experimentation. Here's how I approached building mine.

## The Tech Stack

I chose a modern stack that balances developer experience with performance:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for the framework
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **MDX** for blog content

## Design Philosophy

The design follows a minimalist approach with a monospace aesthetic using JetBrains Mono throughout. Key principles:

1. **Simplicity first** - Clean layouts that let the content shine
2. **Subtle animations** - Framer Motion for smooth transitions without being distracting
3. **Consistent spacing** - Using Tailwind's spacing scale for visual rhythm

## Project Structure

I organized the codebase using a feature-based structure:

```
src/
├── app/           # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/
│   ├── layout/    # Navbar, Footer
│   ├── sections/  # Page sections
│   └── ui/        # Reusable components
├── content/       # MDX blog posts
├── data/          # Static data files
├── lib/           # Utilities
└── types/         # TypeScript types
```

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio reinforced several important concepts:

- **Type-first development** pays off in maintainability
- **Component composition** makes complex UIs manageable
- **Static generation** in Next.js is incredibly powerful for content sites

## What's Next

I plan to continue iterating on this portfolio, adding:

- More blog posts about technical topics
- Interactive demos and code playgrounds
- Performance optimizations
