Claude Code has been shipping features fast. Here are five that are worth setting up today — each one changes how you work with the tool in a meaningful way.

→ [Skip to Setting Everything Up](#setting-everything-up)

## 1. opusplan — Smart Model Switching

The `opusplan` alias automatically uses **Opus for planning and reasoning**, then switches to **Sonnet for code execution**. You get Opus-quality architecture decisions without paying Opus prices for every line of generated code.

```bash
# Start a session with opusplan
claude --model opusplan

# Or switch mid-session
/model opusplan
```

When you enter plan mode (designing an approach, breaking down a task), Claude uses Opus. The moment it starts writing code, it drops to Sonnet. You don't have to manage the switch manually.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This is particularly useful for large refactors — Opus reasons through the architecture, Sonnet does the repetitive implementation work.
</Callout>

You can also set it permanently via environment variable or settings file:

```bash
# Environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=opusplan
```

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "model": "opusplan"
}
```

## 2. Agent Teams — Multiple Claudes Working Together

This one is experimental, but it's already powerful. Agent teams let you spin up **multiple Claude Code instances** that coordinate with each other — one acts as a team lead, the others work on tasks in parallel.

Enable it first:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Then describe the team you want in natural language:

```
Create an agent team to refactor the auth module.
Spawn three teammates:
- One for the backend API changes
- One for the frontend components
- One for writing tests
```

Claude creates a shared task list, spawns teammates, and coordinates the work. Teammates communicate with each other, claim tasks, and report back to the lead.

**Best use cases:**

- **Parallel code review** — one reviewer for security, one for performance, one for test coverage
- **Debugging competing hypotheses** — multiple agents investigate different theories simultaneously
- **Cross-layer features** — frontend, backend, and tests each owned by a different teammate

<Callout variant="note">
  Agent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Start with research and review tasks to get a feel for how they work before using them for implementation.
</Callout>

Two display modes are available: **in-process** (all in one terminal, navigate with `Shift+Up/Down`) and **split panes** (each teammate in its own tmux/iTerm2 pane). Use `Shift+Tab` to enable delegate mode, which restricts the lead to coordination only.

## 3. Fast Mode — Same Quality, Lower Latency

<Callout variant="warning">
  Fast mode requires extra usage to be enabled on your account and is billed separately from your subscription.
</Callout>

Fast mode delivers **faster Opus responses** using a different API configuration. Same model, same quality — just quicker output at a higher per-token cost.

Toggle it with:

```
/fast
```

A <span style={{color: '#E07A2F'}}>↯</span> icon appears next to your prompt while fast mode is active. Run `/fast` again to toggle it off.

| Mode                      | Input (per MTok) | Output (per MTok) |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Standard Opus             | $15              | $75                |
| Fast Opus (under 200K)    | $30              | $150               |
| Fast Opus (over 200K)     | $60              | $225               |

**When to use it:**

- Rapid iteration on code changes
- Live debugging where you're waiting on every response
- Time-sensitive work

**When to skip it:**

- Long autonomous tasks where latency doesn't matter
- CI/CD pipelines or batch processing
- When you're optimizing for cost

<Callout variant="tip">
  Enable fast mode at the start of a session rather than mid-conversation. Switching mid-session re-prices the entire context at fast mode rates.
</Callout>

## 4. Effort Levels — Control How Hard Claude Thinks

The effort parameter controls how many tokens Claude spends on reasoning. Lower effort means faster, cheaper responses. Higher effort means deeper analysis.

Four levels are available:

| Level    | When to use it                                          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `max`    | Deepest reasoning, no token constraints (Opus only)    |
| `high`   | Default — complex reasoning, difficult coding problems  |
| `medium` | Balanced speed and quality for routine agentic tasks    |
| `low`    | Simple tasks, quick lookups, maximum speed              |

**Set it in Claude Code:**

- Use the `/model` command and adjust with **left/right arrow keys**
- Environment variable: `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL=low|medium|high`
- Settings file: `"effortLevel": "medium"`

Effort affects everything — text responses, tool calls, and extended thinking. At lower levels, Claude makes fewer tool calls, skips preamble, and gets straight to the point.

You can combine effort with fast mode: use `low` effort + fast mode for maximum speed on straightforward tasks, or `high` effort + standard mode for deep analysis where you don't mind waiting.

## 5. sonnet[1m] — 1 Million Token Context

Standard context windows are 200K tokens. The `[1m]` suffix extends that to **1 million tokens** — useful for large codebases or long sessions where you don't want Claude to lose track of earlier context.

```bash
claude --model sonnet[1m]
```

The `[1m]` suffix works with aliases and full model names:

```bash
/model sonnet[1m]
/model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929[1m]
```

<Callout variant="warning">
  Extended context models have [different pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#long-context-pricing). The 1M context window is currently available only for organizations (API and pay-as-you-go users). Pro, Max, Teams, and Enterprise subscription users do not have access to Opus 1M context at launch.
</Callout>

When should you use this? If you're working across dozens of files, doing large migrations, or running sessions that last hours — the extended window keeps everything in scope.

## Setting Everything Up

All of these features can be configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "opusplan",
  "effortLevel": "high",
  "fastMode": false,
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```

Or mix and match with flags and slash commands during a session:

```bash
claude --model sonnet[1m]    # Start with extended context
/model opusplan              # Switch to hybrid mode
/fast                        # Toggle fast mode
```

The official docs cover each feature in detail:

- [Model configuration](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config) — opusplan, extended context, effort levels
- [Agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) — multi-instance orchestration
- [Fast mode](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode) — lower latency responses
- [Effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) — API-level effort parameter
