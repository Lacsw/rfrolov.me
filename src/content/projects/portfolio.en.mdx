## The Challenge

Creating a portfolio that effectively showcases technical skills while maintaining a clean, professional aesthetic. The goal was to build something that demonstrates modern frontend capabilities without sacrificing performance or accessibility.

## Technical Decisions

### Next.js 16 with App Router

The latest version of Next.js provides excellent performance with Turbopack and the App Router pattern. Key benefits:

- **Server Components** for optimal performance
- **Static Generation** for lightning-fast page loads
- **Built-in internationalization** support
- **File-based routing** for clean project structure

### Tailwind CSS v4

For styling, I chose Tailwind CSS v4 for its:

- **Utility-first approach** enabling rapid prototyping
- **CSS variable theming** for consistent design tokens
- **Excellent performance** with automatic purging
- **Great developer experience** with IDE support

### Framer Motion

Animations are powered by Framer Motion, providing:

- **Declarative API** for complex animations
- **Spring physics** for natural motion
- **Layout animations** for smooth transitions
- **Gesture support** for interactive elements

## Key Features

### Multilingual Support

Full i18n implementation with English and German, including:

- URL-based locale switching
- Translated content and UI strings
- SEO-optimized alternate links

### Blog Platform

MDX-powered technical blog featuring:

- Syntax highlighting with Shiki
- Custom callout components
- Reading time estimation
- Tag-based filtering

### Creative 404 Page

A terminal-style 404 page that:

- Simulates command-line interactions
- Shows playful error messages
- Provides clear navigation options

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio reinforced several important concepts:

- **Type-first development** pays off in maintainability
- **Component composition** makes complex UIs manageable
- **Static generation** is incredibly powerful for content sites
- **Accessibility matters** - semantic HTML and keyboard navigation
